Hotel Reservation System – Project Plan
1. Project Structure
Number of classes: 6
Classes and purpose:
Room – abstract base class for all rooms, contains room number, price, and availability
SingleRoom – subclass of Room, represents single rooms
DoubleRoom – subclass of Room, represents double rooms
Guest – stores guest information (name, age, phone)
Booking – stores booking information for a guest in a room for a certain number of nights
Main – demonstrates program functionality: creating objects, filtering, searching, and sorting

Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
Encapsulation:
All fields in Room, Guest, and Booking are private.
Access is through getters and setters.

private String name;
public String getName() { return name; }
public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }

Inheritance:
SingleRoom and DoubleRoom inherit from Room.
They reuse common fields and methods from Room, reducing code repetition.
Polymorphism:
The abstract method getRoomType() in Room is overridden in SingleRoom and DoubleRoom.
This allows the program to handle all rooms the same way, while their behavior differs.
Example:\

@Override
public String getRoomType() {
    return "Single"; // SingleRoom
}
@Override
public String getRoomType() {
    return "Double"; // DoubleRoom
}


Overloaded Methods (Overload)
In the Booking class, there are multiple constructors demonstrating method overloading:

public Booking() { } // Default constructor
public Booking(Guest guest, Room room, int nights) { ... } // Overloaded constructor

Overridden Methods (Override)
In Room:
toString() – prints room information
equals() – compares rooms by number
hashCode() – provides unique hash for collections

@Override
public String toString() { ... }
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) { ... }
@Override
public int hashCode() { ... }

Summary: Overriding these methods helps to print rooms nicely, compare them correctly, and work well in lists or sets.


Data Pool: Filtering, Searching, and Sorting
Data pool: all rooms are stored in an ArrayList<Room>.
Filtering: show only available rooms:

Summary

Project shows encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, method overloading and overriding.
Rooms are stored in a data pool (ArrayList) with filtering, searching, and sorting.
The program is easy to extend: you can add new room types, more guest info, or additional booking features.





# Assignment 3

This project demonstrates JDBC connection to PostgreSQL and basic CRUD operations.

## Features
- Java JDBC connection (PostgreSQL)
- Two tables: guests and rooms
- CRUD operations:
  - Create (add guest / room)
  - Read (view guests)
  - Update (update guest phone)
  - Delete (delete guest)

## Technologies
- Java
- PostgreSQL
- JDBC
- IntelliJ IDEA

## How to run
1. Run MainDB.java
2. Data will be inserted, updated and displayed in console.
